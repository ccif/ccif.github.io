This poll got me wondering: if we're able to hit the button as many times as we want, what are the odds of killing someone I know? Is there an optimal number of presses to stop at?

The underlying problem is sampling without replacement from a finite population containing exactly two types of objects: either people I care about or people I don't. This can be represented as a hypergeometric distribution. 

Given a population of `N` items where `s` items belong to a set S, what's the probability that at least one of the `s` items from S appears when we randomly sample `k` items without replacement?

$$
P(X \geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - \frac{\binom{N-s}{k}}{\binom{N}{k}}
$$

Seems like it's pretty hard for me to accidentally kill someone I know. I don't think it's unreasonable to hit the button thousands or even tens of thousands of times. Probability would be on my side.
